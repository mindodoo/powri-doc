# Implementation Readiness Assessment Report

**Date:** 2026-06-12  
**Project:** japan_winter_sport  
**Assessor:** BMAD Implementation Readiness workflow  
**Scope:** Phase 1 (FR-1 through FR-7)

---

## Document Discovery

### Inventory

| Document type | Location | Status |
|---------------|----------|--------|
| **PRD** | `japan_ski_prd.md` (repo root, v1.1 approved) | ✅ Primary |
| **Architecture** | `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md` (complete) | ✅ |
| **Epics & Stories** | `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` (5 epics, 27 stories) | ✅ |
| **UX Design** | `ux-designs/ux-japan_winter_sport-2026-06-12/DESIGN.md` (final) | ✅ |
| **UX Experience** | `ux-designs/ux-japan_winter_sport-2026-06-12/EXPERIENCE.md` (final) | ✅ |
| **UX Mocks** | `ux-designs/.../mockups/*.html` (4 key screens) | ✅ |
| **Tracking plan** | `docs/tracking-plan.md` | ✅ |
| **Content model** | `content/CONTENT_MODEL.md` | ✅ |
| **PRD validation** | `prd-validation-2026-06-12/*` | ℹ️ Reference only (superseded by v1.1) |

### Duplicates & conflicts

- **No duplicate formats** — PRD is whole-file at repo root (not sharded in planning-artifacts). No conflict with epics/architecture.
- **Dual UX sources:** PRD §12 remains marked canonical in epics; standalone `DESIGN.md` / `EXPERIENCE.md` are newer and more precise. **Resolution:** Treat UX spines as primary for implementation; PRD §12 as historical reference. Spines explicitly win on conflict.

### Missing documents

None required for Phase 1 implementation start.

## PRD Analysis

### Functional Requirements (Phase 1)

| ID | Requirement summary |
|----|---------------------|
| **FR-1** | Home/Explore: 20 resort cards, filter chips, search, navigate to detail with analytics |
| **FR-2** | Detail: hero, verdict, highlights/lowlights, terrain, season-labelled T2, trail map link, Unsplash attribution, Getting There reachable |
| **FR-3** | Getting There: ≥2 transport options, gateway experiences, collapsible practical tips |

| **FR-5** | Onboarding: ≤4 cards, skip/start, one-time local flag, no hero photos |
| **FR-6** | AI chat: floating CTA, seed-content Q&A, §4.4 guardrails, chat analytics events |
| **FR-7** | Info tab: About, Privacy/ToS links, contact, version |

**Total Phase 1 FRs: 7**

### Non-Functional Requirements (extracted)

| ID | Category |
|----|----------|
| NFR-1 | Mobile-first 375–430px; bottom nav always visible |
| NFR-2 | SSG/ISR performance; all 20 resorts reachable ≤2 taps |
| NFR-3 | Security: CSP, SRI, HTTPS, sanitization, server-side API keys, rate limits |
| NFR-4 | GDPR/PDPA consent; anonymous analytics default |
| NFR-5 | Markdown build-time content pipeline; no CMS Phase 1 |
| NFR-6 | Season labels on T2 fields; last-reviewed signal |
| NFR-7 | Unsplash attribution on every image |
| NFR-8 | Full Phase 1 analytics per `tracking-plan.md` |
| NFR-9 | AI cost guardrails (turn/token/IP/kill-switch) |
| NFR-10 | Accessibility baseline (contrast, 44px targets, semantic HTML) |
| NFR-11 | npm audit clean; lockfile committed |
| NFR-12 | Clean outbound links |
| NFR-13 | Counter-metrics + satisfaction micro-survey |
| NFR-14 | i18n scaffold; EN only ships |

**Total NFRs in epics inventory: 14**

### Additional constraints

- All 20 resorts `content_status: published` before launch (§10.2 content-freeze gate)
- Legal pages before GTM Ring 2 public sharing (§17)
- No monetisation / affiliate code Phase 1
- Unsplash bulk fetch on hold pending app approval

### PRD completeness assessment

PRD v1.1 is **complete and approved** for Phase 1 epics. Minor typo: FR-2 acceptance criteria references "FR-4" for Getting There — should read FR-3 (documentation only, no implementation impact).

## UX Alignment Assessment

### UX document status

**Found and final:**
- `DESIGN.md` — Theme A tokens, components, do's/don'ts
- `EXPERIENCE.md` — IA, flows (Alex + Ninja personas), states, a11y floor
- 4 HTML mocks (Home, Detail, Quiz, Quiz results)

### UX ↔ PRD alignment

| Area | Alignment |
|------|-----------|
| Phase 1 screens (0, 0b, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6) | ✅ Matches PRD §12.5 screen index |
| Bottom nav Home · Explore · Info | ✅ Consistent |
| Theme A Default | ✅ Locked in UX; matches PRD §12.2 |
| Motion budget (300ms max, crossfade hero) | ✅ EXPERIENCE.md §12.8 equivalent |
| AI Phase 1 scope (no live search) | ✅ Consistent |
| Voice/tone | ✅ Consistent |

**Minor drift:** Epics still cite "PRD §12" and UX-DR labels rather than linking to `DESIGN.md` / `EXPERIENCE.md` paths. Content is aligned; **update story references during sprint planning** for agent clarity.

### UX ↔ Architecture alignment

| UX requirement | Architecture support | Status |
|----------------|---------------------|--------|
| Theme A CSS tokens | `src/styles/tokens.css` + Tailwind | ✅ |
| BottomNav, components | Feature folders under `src/components/` | ✅ |
| Shared-element transition | View Transitions API / CSS (noted as nice-to-have) | 🟡 Cosmetic — user expects in-browser polish |
| Quiz ranked results (Ninja flow) | `lib/quiz/score.ts` — weights deferred | 🟡 Algorithm TBD |
| Zustand for quiz/onboarding | Architecture picks Zustand (epics allowed either) | ✅ Resolved |
| i18n | Architecture: `next-intl`; Epic 1.7: generic scaffold | ✅ Compatible |
| PostHog events per flow | `lib/analytics/track.ts` + tracking plan | ✅ |
| AI keyboard-aware input | Full-screen overlay in App Router | ✅ |
| Lucide icons | Not in architecture; UX ASSUMPTION | 🟡 Add to architecture or DESIGN.md |

### UX ↔ Epics alignment

All 18 UX-DRs map to epic stories. Key flows (Alex, Ninja) are in EXPERIENCE.md but **not explicitly referenced in story ACs** — recommend adding persona acceptance notes to Story 2.7 (quiz) during sprint planning.

### Warnings

- **No UX gap** for Phase 1 UI — spines are implementation-ready.
- **Cosmetic polish** explicitly deferred to in-browser iteration (logged in UX decision log) — acceptable.

## Epic Quality Review

### Epic structure validation

| Epic | User value? | Independent? | Verdict |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Epic 1: App Foundation | 🟡 Enables all journeys (nav, content, analytics) | ✅ Stands alone | **Acceptable** — foundation epic with visible BottomNav; not a pure "DB setup" anti-pattern |
| Epic 2: Discover | ✅ | ✅ After Epic 1 | ✅ |
| Epic 3: Detail & Getting There | ✅ | ✅ After Epic 1–2 | ✅ |
| Epic 4: AI Assistant | ✅ | ✅ After Epic 1,3 (detail context) | ✅ |
| Epic 5: Info & Launch | ✅ | ✅ After Epic 1 | ✅ |

**Epic ordering:** 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 is correct. Epic 4 does not block Epics 2–3.

### Story quality findings

#### 🔴 Critical violations

**None.** No forward dependencies that block story completion within sequence.

#### 🟠 Major issues

1. **Story 3.6 cross-epic stub (Epic 3 → Epic 4)**  
   - AI button may show placeholder until Epic 4.1.  
   - **Mitigation:** Documented in epics final validation. Epic 3 is shippable; FR-6 completes in Epic 4. **Acceptable** if sprint order enforced.

2. **Quiz scoring algorithm unspecified**  
   - Ninja persona success depends on defensible ranking.  
   - **Recommendation:** Add scoring spec to `architecture.md` or new `docs/quiz-scoring.md` before Story 2.7 implementation.

3. **Content launch gate — all resorts draft**  
   - All 20 `content/resorts/*.md` files have `content_status: "draft"`.  
   - **Impact:** Blocks launch (§10.2), not dev start. Story 1.3 allows dev warnings for unpublished slugs.  
   - **Recommendation:** Track content publish as parallel workstream before launch gate.

4. **NFR-10 accessibility not in story ACs**  
   - No story explicitly validates contrast, focus order, or screen reader labels.  
   - **Recommendation:** Add a11y checklist to Epic 5 Story 5.5 launch gate ACs.

#### 🟡 Minor concerns

1. **CI/CD** — Story 1.1 says "CI-ready" but no `.github/workflows` story; architecture mentions GitHub Actions. Add during Epic 1 or 5.

2. **Legal page copy** — Stories 5.2 require Privacy/ToS pages; **content not drafted yet** (separate from app code).

3. **Epic 1 Story 1.1** — Uses "As a developer" user type (technical story). Acceptable as greenfield bootstrap per create-epics-and-stories starter-template rule.

4. **Leaflet** — Listed in epics additional requirements; architecture correctly defers to Phase 2. No Phase 1 conflict.

### Best practices checklist (summary)

| Check | Epic 1 | Epic 2 | Epic 3 | Epic 4 | Epic 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| User value | 🟡 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Epic independence | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Story sizing | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| No forward deps | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 3.6 stub | ✅ | ✅ |
| Clear ACs (G/W/T) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| FR traceability | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

### Starter template compliance

✅ Epic 1 Story 1.1 matches architecture `create-next-app` command into `web/` subdirectory.

---

## Summary and Recommendations

### Overall readiness status

## **READY WITH MINOR GAPS**

Planning artifacts are **aligned and sufficient to begin implementation** (Epic 1 Story 1.1). Gaps below affect launch quality or specific stories — not the decision to start building.

### Strengths

- **100% FR coverage** across 5 user-value epics and 27 stories
- PRD, UX spines, architecture, and epics **agree on stack, scope, and Phase 1 boundaries**
- Architecture provides **agent consistency rules** (naming, structure, API shape, analytics)
- UX personas (Alex, Ninja) validate quiz and detail-page honesty requirements
- Starter template and first story are **explicit and executable**

### Critical issues (before public launch — not before dev start)

| # | Issue | Action |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | All 20 resorts `content_status: draft` | Publish all resorts per §10.2 content-freeze gate |
| 2 | Privacy Policy & ToS content not drafted | Write legal copy before Ring 2 sharing (Story 5.2) |

### Recommended fixes before / during sprint (minor gaps)

| # | Issue | Action | When |
|---|-------|--------|------|
| 1 | Quiz scoring weights undefined | Document `lib/quiz/score.ts` rules; test with Ninja persona answers | Before Story 2.7 |
| 2 | NFR-10 not in story ACs | Add a11y checks to Story 5.5 launch checklist | Sprint planning |
| 3 | Epics cite PRD §12 vs UX spine paths | Update story refs to `DESIGN.md` / `EXPERIENCE.md` | Sprint planning |
| 4 | CI workflow not storied | Add GitHub Actions lint/build/audit to Epic 1 or 5 | Epic 1 |
| 5 | Lucide icon choice | Confirm in architecture or DESIGN.md | Epic 1 Story 1.2 |

### Recommended next steps

1. **[SP] Sprint planning** — `bmad-sprint-planning` — sequence 27 stories with content + legal parallel tracks
2. **[DS] Dev Story** — Epic 1 Story 1.1: run `create-next-app` into `web/`
3. **Content parallel track** — begin moving resorts from `draft` → `published` (does not block app shell)
4. **Optional:** Draft quiz scoring doc before Epic 2 Story 2.7

### Final note

This assessment found **0 critical planning blockers for starting implementation** and **5 minor gaps** to close before launch or specific stories. The planning stack (PRD → UX → Architecture → Epics) is coherent. Proceed to sprint planning and Epic 1.
